            <p class="introduction">
                This savory salad is the perfect addition to a dinner party or as a last minute meal. This vegan adaptation of the classic Tuscan Panzanella Salad is full of flavor and fresh textures which are easilyprepared in under 15 minutes! For best results, assemble the moist and dry components just before serving as the bread will become soggy if left combined. The heirloom tomatoes are at peak flavour during late summer to early fall, but if none are available, Roma tomatoes will make a great substitution. 

                The only common allergy is the gluten in the foccacia, which is easily substituted with your favorite gluten-free loaf!

                <u><b>Directions</b></u>
                <li>In a large skillet, add 3 tablespoons of olive oil and bring to medium-high heat. Once hot, throw in the capers and cook for 6-8 minutes, stirring every so often, until crispy. Taste one to make sure they are crispy and then remove from the skillet. Set them aside to garnish at the very end.</li>
                <li>Next, place sliced bread in the same skillet with leftover oil and pan-fry until golden brown on both sides, about 3 minutes on each side. Drizzle in a little bit more oil, if needed. You want the slices to get toasty brown but still remain somewhat chewy on the inside. Once done, add the bread to a beautiful large salad bowl and set aside.</li>
                <li>For the dressing, in a separate small pan, add the butter and bring to medium-high heat. Throw in the shallots, garlic, crushed red pepper flakes, oregano leaves, thyme leaves, and a sprinkling of salt and pepper. Bring to a sizzle and cook for a few minutes until the shallots and garlic are tender and the oregano leaves are crisped and curled. Remove from heat and set aside</li>
                <li>Time to assemble! Add the sliced tomatoes to the large salad bowl with bread and gently toss. Add a few splashes of red wine vinegar (about 1 tablespoon). Using a spoon, spread the dressing over the bread and tomatoes and then pour every last drop out. Gently toss again. Right before serving, sprinkle the fried capers over the top and a bit of flaky salt, to taste. Eat immediately.</li>
