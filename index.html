                A spin on the classic Panzanella with punchy fried capers, a fresh homemade shallot dressing, <br>sliced and toasted foccacia, and beautiful heirloom tomatoes.
            </p>

            <ul class="ingred">
                <u>Ingredients</u>
                <li>3 tablespoons olive oil</li>
                <li><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> cup capers, drained and patted dry</li>
                <li>7 oz sourdough focaccia bread, thinly sliced into 2-inch pieces, <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> inch thick</li>
                <li>3 heaping tablespoons vegan butter</li>
                <li>1 large shallot, sliced</li>
                <li>3 cloves garlic, chopped</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon fresh oregano leaves</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon fresh thyme leaves</li>
                <li>Fresh cracked black pepper & salt to taste</li>
                <li>2 pounds heirloom tomatoes, sliced into 2-inch pieces, <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> inch thick</li>
            </ul>
            <ol class="direct">
                <u>Directions</u>
                <li>In a large skillet, add 3 tablespoons of olive oil and bring to medium-high heat. Once hot, throw in the capers and cook for 6-8 minutes, stirring every so often, until crispy. Taste one to make sure they are crispy and then remove from the skillet. Set them aside to garnish at the very end.</li>
                <li>Next, place sliced bread in the same skillet with leftover oil and pan-fry until golden brown on both sides, about 3 minutes on each side. Drizzle in a little bit more oil, if needed. You want the slices to get toasty brown but still remain somewhat chewy on the inside. Once done, add the bread to a beautiful large salad bowl and set aside.</li>
                <li>For the dressing, in a separate small pan, add the butter and bring to medium-high heat. Throw in the shallots, garlic, crushed red pepper flakes, oregano leaves, thyme leaves, and a sprinkling of salt and pepper. Bring to a sizzle and cook for a few minutes until the shallots and garlic are tender and the oregano leaves are crisped and curled. Remove from heat and set aside</li>
                <li>Time to assemble! Add the sliced tomatoes to the large salad bowl with bread and gently toss. Add a few splashes of red wine vinegar (about 1 tablespoon). Using a spoon, spread the dressing over the bread and tomatoes and then pour every last drop out. Gently toss again. Right before serving, sprinkle the fried capers over the top and a bit of flaky salt, to taste. Eat immediately.</li>

                    This recipe page has a simplified design with all the expected elements of a web recipe. The margins between the large photographs and text below are shorter than expected, the page is airy and uncluttered. This makes it flow seamlessly, unlike many recipe pages that scroll endlessly.

                    This recipe website stood out to me in my research because it uses an engaging grid that makes good use of the page real estate. The design is especially eyecatching and inviting, using several typefaces and sizes across sections.

                    I use this site often to listen to music, I really like how they use images and album work independently and create an interesting visual hierachy. The horizontal lists are another interesting feature that engages the user and screen space.

                    This essay and media site takes up more of the space with images upon entering each pages. The scroll over animations/movements have several subtle actions that orient and direct the user.

                    This site is a part of a research project and is a timeline of Swiss graphic and typographic designs. The entry screen from the initial timeline brings up a short catalogue of relevant sourced materials. The interction between the home and catalogue screens is really playful.
