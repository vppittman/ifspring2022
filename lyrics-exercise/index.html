                <br>Trying to please
                <br>All these people around me
                <br>Is trying to reach for the moon
                <br>(The Moon)
                <br>I see their faces looking so empty saying
                <br> I hope that they'll finish soon
                <br>(So Soon)
                <br>Could be a chat show
                <br>(Yap Yap Yap)
                <br>Could be a go go
                <br>Reaction would be the same
                <br>(The Same)
                <br>So here I go
                <br>Though why I don't know
                <br>Trying to prove myself again
        
                <br>
                <br>Chorus
                <br>

                <br>Entertain me
                <br>I'm as blank as can be
                <br>And I've seen it before
                <br>And I've done it before
                <br>And I think that I like it
                <br>But no I don't like it
                <br>It just goes on over and over
                <br>And over and over and over again
            
                <br>

                <br>I try to give them all of my best
                <br>And it's taking a turn for the worst
                <br>(Oh No)
                <br>Things going wrong
                <br>Start to sing the wrong song
                <br>I think that we must be cursed
                <br>(You Betcha)
                <br>Playing the wrong tune
                <br>Hitting the wrong note
                <br>This is where my nerves become frayed
                <br>It's falling apart
                <br>Why did we ever start
                <br>And do you think we'll be paid
                <br>(No No)
                
                <br>
                <br>Chorus
                <br>

                <br>Over and over again
                <br>Build 'em up, knock 'em down (x5)       

                <br>

                <br>I see a movement
                <br>Down in the front row
                <br>Maybe it's just a mistake
                <br>She's smiling at me
                <br>(Hello)
                <br>But he's frowning at me
                <br>(Goodbye)
                <br>Which conclusion
                <br>Do I make
                <br>Fold all your arms
                <br>And look straight ahead
                <br>At this puppet on a string
                <br>You're feeling confused
                <br>But you've made a decision
                <br>You don't like anything

                <br>
                <br>Chorus
                <br>

                <br>Build 'em up, knock em down (x4)
                
                <br>
                <br>Chorus
                <br>

Trying to please
All these people around me
Is trying to reach for the moon
(The Moon)
I see their faces looking so empty saying
I hope that they'll finish soon
(So Soon)
Could be a chat show
(Yap Yap Yap)
Could be a go go
Reaction would be the same
(The Same)
So here I go
Though why I don't know
Trying to prove myself again

Chorus–
Entertain me
I'm as blank as can be
And I've seen it before
And I've done it before
And I think that I like it
But no I don't like it
It just goes on over and over
And over and over and over again

I try to give them all of my best
And it's taking a turn for the worst
(Oh No)
Things going wrong
Start to sing the wrong song
I think that we must be cursed
(You Betcha)
Playing the wrong tune
Hitting the wrong note
This is where my nerves become frayed
It's falling apart
Why did we ever start
And do you think we'll be paid
(No No)

Chorus

Over and over again
Build 'em up, knock 'em down (x5)

I see a movement
Down in the front row
Maybe it's just a mistake
She's smiling at me
(Hello)
But he's frowning at me
(Goodbye)
Which conclusion
Do I make
Fold all your arms
And look straight ahead
At this puppet on a string
You're feeling confused
But you've made a decision
You don't like anything

Chorus

Build 'em up, knock em down (x4)

Chorus
